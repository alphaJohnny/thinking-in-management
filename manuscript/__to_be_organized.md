# Chapter 1 - Why us, Why now ?

>Entitled and richly deserving of the 1000 times more money than an average person made by working hard is exactly how kings, queens and nobility felt. They ruled and gave us the darkest times in human history. Times of stifled growth, stifled innovation and excruciating wars.

As a manager, and a good one that I had become after a while of learning this craft, I realized that what I do everyday is just common sense, but I get paid so much more for it. Very soon, I felt that I deserved the 135 times more that I was getting paid of an average employee. Only to reflect back and understand that  entitled and richly deserving of the 1000 times more money than an average person made by working hard is exactly how kings, queens and nobility felt. They ruled and gave us the darkest times in human history. Times of stifled growth, stifled innovation and excruciating wars.

Then came democracy and one of the most explosive periods of growth that our civilization has every experienced. However our corporations for the most part are still run as if they are ruled by a ruler and his henchmen. No wonder such autocratically ruled corporations are dying at a rapid pace - the average age of an S&P 500 corporation is just 15 years now. Which means that on an average in 15 years every one of the S&P500 corporation will be dead and replaced by a better, more democratic, more innovative, more decentralized corporation.

And the same might be case of democratic rule in countries. In the last 50 years in almost every country in the world, cunning people have figured out how to hijack democracy and make it work for them personally. These cunning individuals take over law making of that country. They take over it's money supply and it's natural resources and throw everyone else in that country in a deep cycle of improvishness and servitude.

I heard Jeff Bezos state his dream that he wishes for a trillion human beings in space. He wishes for 1000s of Einstein's, 1000s of Mozarts - what a wonderful world will that be. Is a world like that possible? Truly, it is. Is it probable? NO, unless we democratize the principals and practice of management, leadership and governance - from corporations to countries to the world.

# Why me

I was a great programmer and a very good product manager.  I had an ability to understand the needs of my customers, a talent to fit together the pieces of available technology and thereby align technology and customers needs precisely. And I had done this with extreme success for 10s of large companies including Citibank, GE, Bank of America and many others.

But I failed horribly as a manager and a co-founder, even thought understanding and aligning disparate pieces together is what management and leadership are all about. I was quite taken back from my failure. I didn't think a person of my intelligence should have failed. I didn't think a person of my niceness deserved a failure. But, people were failing me and failing me without me fully understanding why.

This threw me into a depression for 18 months. Simply the worst time for my family and me.  They had to bear me with all the fury of a cranky, miserable, sore looser.

This started almost a year before I finally decided to shut down my startup. I had changed into this person that I didn't like. I had become unhealthy, spiteful and internally miserable. I was at this point killing everything in and around me. I was killing myself. I was killing my relationship. I wasn't the dad that I wished for my son to have and I was being drained financially.

# Back to normal

But having the same Grit that defines any great programmer and every great scientist, I was no stranger to failure. My code like almost everyone else's didn't work, didn't work, didn't work - till it eventually did work. This has happened to me millions of times. In fact this was an everyday thing for me at work. Then why was I getting so caught into it? Why not logically work through it?

>the primary reason for frustration is repeated failure without an understanding of why it's happening and how to fix it.

Well, I didn't understand it back then. I was too depressed to let my mind work. I had overburdened it with useless, counterproductive emotions and it had come to a grinding halt. Later, as I recovered I realized that the primary reason for frustration is repeated failure without an understanding of why it's happening and how to fix it.
