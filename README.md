# Thinking in management
An open source collaborative book on management. Focused and written primarily for startups in the 50 people onwards growth stage, but should be equally valid for large corporations.

The goal is to provide a very easy to use, easy to remember and easy to implement methodology.  To demystify psychology, management and leadership. To do to it what engineers always do, understand ambiguity and complexity. Then structure it, lay-down the rules, algorithm'ize it and issue some best practices.

What drives apart Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Jack Welch ? Why do they stand apart from from regular run of the mill managers, most of whom are driving their corporations in to the ground. Yes, they are, the average age of an S&P 500 corporation is now merely 16 years. While the average PE is 21.4 (chuckle).

Let me put this in simple terms. On an average, if a corporation makes 10 bucks a year, investors are paying 214 dollars to get ownership of it. The corporation however is statistically proven to go belly up in 16 years.

Further, a failing corporation is destined to provide negative returns in the last few years of its existence. Thereby, we can forecast a return of $100 over the next 10 years on a $214 investment. This is the average scenario and not all companies / stocks will behave in this manner. But, despite this, the stock market keeps rising, thanks to Quantitative Easing and the still-alive Yellen Put. This is a classic example of the "bigger fool theory" where you hope for another bigger fool to take it off your hands at a better price.

# Why
I believe creative, smart, ambitious engineers make the best managers and the best leaders. They think logically, they think long term, they think in a non-zero sum manner, they think in terms of solving problems for good, not creating more later.

Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Jack Welch are great examples of this.

On the contrary, we notice that most of corporate world is ruled by Marketers, Sales people, Investors, or Professional Management people who don't have deep domain expertise or a passion for that industry. They just use this as a manner of enriching themselves and then spend all that money on luxury yacht or other toys. They don't add back to the industry like the Engineer-Leaders do.

# Why me
I have worked in 17 cities in 7 countries. I have worked for 10 very large corporations. I have co-founded or worked in 3 startups. I have implemented CRM and ERP systems that involved touching every layer of management in every functional division of corporations - from CEOs to rank and file managers, from accounting to IT.  They least I can do with this wide experience and seeing all that I have, is to give back - to do what I can to help make complexity more understandable and thereby make this world a better place.

# Why Now
In early 2019 when I started this project, the news media was ablaze with reports on Boeing and its 737 Max 8 aircraft. And, not of the good kind, two of Boeing's 737 Max 8 aircraft had nose dived killing everyone onboard within the last few months. What went wrong? The management at Boeing decided in 2010 to push out making a better aircraft by a decade. They were hoping to make profits by reducing development costs. They instead counted on their lobbying efforts and high pressure sales techniques to keep selling older crap. Can you imagine Elon Musk doing it? And when completion was at their doors of Boeing, their CEO boldly stated that "Airbus will fail in keeping costs low and will not be able to deliver the A320 Neo", which later proved to be completely wrong.

, one could see the tragedy and havoc caused by wrong management. The entire upper management at Boeing is made of sales people and bean counters. They willingly

I can't think of a more narcissistic view of the world. People betting that they will be safe because they trust their competition to fail. Can you think of Michael Jordan not taking a shot because he doesn't need to, that he has the confidence that opposing team is not going to be able to pull it off!. You don't count your success on other's failures, and especially not anticipated failures.

Later when American Airlines divulged that they might be looking at placing large orders for the Airbus 320 Neo, Boeing hurriedly put something together that had such serious flaws that it literally feel from the skies thereby killing 100s, hurting thousands and causing real inconvenience to millions.

I am fairly sure that the cost of all lawsuits by families, claims by all airlines in the world who had to ground their planes and further pricing pressure due to a completely devastatingly destroyed reputation will not result in a single cent of savings, in fact I can see them declaring huge losses for the next decade.

All this is when the average cost of a seat in an aircraft is about 1 million.  Yes, you read it right. The small little economy seat that can barely hold the bums of an increasingly obese average westerner is an average of 1 million dollars. While an average car seat in a high end car, all decked up in leather and fancy air-conditioning is about 25,000 dollars.

Think about the fact that in a car, the cost of navigation, engine, body and everything is divided amongst only 4 seats while in an aircraft it's divided amongst almost 200 seats.

Apple is another such case. Point me to a revolutionary product they have launched since Steve Job's demise. They seem to be happy and content bypassing taxes, buying back their stock, becoming a finance company and slowing down existing devices through software upgrades so consumers can buy more of their incrementally and marginally better next releases.
