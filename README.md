# Thinking in management
An open source collaborative book on new management. I believe creative, smart, ambitious software developers and engineers make the best managers. They think logicallly, they think long term, they think in a non-zero sum manner, they think in terms of solving problems for good, not creating more later.

Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Jack Welch are great examples of this.

On the contrary, we notice that most of corporate world is ruled by Marketers, Sales people, Investors, or Professional Management people who don't have deep domain expertise or a passion for that industry.

>Sir Humphrey: "Bernard, if the right people don't have power, do you know what happens? The wrong people get it!" [http://www.yes-minister.com/ypmseas2b.htm]

If you look at the recent case of Boeing and it's 737 Max 8 aircraft, you will see the tragedy and what a travesty it is. The entire upper management at Boeing is made of sales people and bean counters. They willingly decided to push out making a better aircraft by a decade. Can you imagine Elon Musk doing it?  And then when competion was at their doors, then hurridly put something together that had such serious flaws that it literally feel from the skies thereby killing 100s, hurting thousands and causing real inconvenice to millions.

Apple is another such case. Point me to a revolutionary product they have launched since Steve Job's demise. They seem to be happy and content bypassing taxes, buying back their stock and slowing down existing devices through software upgrades so consumers can buy more.

If we let impassionate, non-creative, non-growth minded individuals run this world, then what horrible place are we creating for our children ?
